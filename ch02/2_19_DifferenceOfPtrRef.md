Pointer points to an actual object in the memory. Reference binds with an actual object in the memory. Both of them achieves the function of indirectly visiting the other object. They have two main difference:
1. A pointer, itself, is an object. It is allowed to assign value to or copy the value of a pointer. Moreover, during the life span of a pointer, it can point to several different objects. On the contrary, a reference is not an object. It is impossible to let one reference bind with the other object after initilization.
2. A pointer does not have to be assigned a value during definition. Same with the other built-in type, if a pointer, which is defined within a block scope, has not been initialized, it will obtain an unsure value. However, this will not happen to a reference because it requires to be initialized during definition.
