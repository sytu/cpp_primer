Yes. But it would be clear if you always initialize a pointer with a value. If you don't what the pointer needs to point to. Point to nullptr or 0. Then the program will know how to test whether a pointer points to an actual object or not. If you want see if a pointer is legal just need to set the pointer as the condition of an if statement. If the value of a pointer is nullptr, the condition will be false. If not, the condition will be true.
