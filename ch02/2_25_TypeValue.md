a. (1) ip is a pointer with type int, hasn't been initialized, has an unsure value, which is an address in the memory.
   (2) i is a variable with type int, hasn't been initialized, has an unsure value.
   (3) r is a reference with type int, has been initialized with variable i so, as variable i, reference r also has an unsure value. Reference r can be regarded as the alias of the variable i.

b. (1) i is a type int variable, which has an unsure value because it hasn't been initialized.
   (2) ip is a type int pointer that is initiaized with a value of 0. In other words, ip is an empty pointer that doesn't point to any actual object.

c. (1) ip is a type int pointer that has an unsure value, which is an address in the menory,  because pointer ip hasn't been initialized.
   (2) ip2 is a type int variable, which has an unsure value because it hasn't been initialized.
