    1. If all the input is the same, the program is not going to enter the else branch within the loop. It will reach the end and quit the loop. Then the program will print out this integer with the times it occurs. 
    
    2. If all the input is different, the program will not enter the if branch within the loop. Every integer will induce the program to enter the else branch, print out the last integer with its only ouccurence of 1, set the integer just read to be the new currVal and reset the the value of the counter cnt to be 1. After reading all the input, the program prints out the last integer with its only ouccurence of 1.
